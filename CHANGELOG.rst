Major Changes

New Modules
-----------

- NEW ``text_parser`` Parses ASCII text into JSON facts using text_parser engine and YAML-formatted input. Provides a rules-based text parser that is closely modeled after the Ansible playbook language. This parser will iterate over the rules and parse the output of structured ASCII text into a JSON data structure that can be added to the inventory host facts.

- NEW ``textfsm`` Parses ASCII text into JSON facts using textfsm engine and Google TextFSM-formatted input. Provides textfsm rules-based templates to parse data from text. The template acting as parser will iterate of the rules and parse the output of structured ASCII text into a JSON data structure that can be added to the inventory host facts.
